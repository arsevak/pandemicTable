# Restaurant accessory for pandemic use

A design of a mobile serving table in restaurants for pandemic use. The outer table will contain mini tables inside it, one on each side.

The outer table will be handled by the server to collect food from the kitchen that is already placed inside the mini tables by the chef. Once mini tables are received, the server will put the mini tables inside the bigger table and close the lid to protect food from any possible contamination.

When serving the food, the server will open the lid and slowly pull out the food containing mini table and put it aside the customer's table. Once customer has finished their meal, the customer will be expected to put back the plates on the mini table. Once the customer leaves, the server will put back the mini table inside the bigger table and hand it over to the kitchen staff for a proper wash.

This solution minimizes the physical contact between the servers and the customers, hence minimizing the chances of virus spread.
